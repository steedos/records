Record Types
===

Record Types are the basic building blocks or templates for your records.

You can control what your records will be called and what information they will contain.

Record Types are the basic building blocks of records. A Record Type defines the records that use it to meet an organisation's needs or to reflect the records you manage.

Record Types ideally should be used to represent the ownership of information.

Record Types enable administrators to partition information within a database so that users can see either all the information in the database or only the records they should have access to.

Record Types should not be used for purposes they are not intended for - for example, to describe different types of document or record format, for example, Word documents or Excel spreadsheets or to describe different types of correspondence, for example, Rate Payer Notifications or inwards and outwards.

One of the most common and useful methods of setting up your Record Types is to structure the set of Record Types to replicate the structure of your organisation - for example, a different document Record Type for each section or division. This will ensure that the search filter function can include or exclude Record Types from a search.

This approach to Record Type setup enables each section to maintain historically and contextually accurate records that are specific to their requirements and enables a scalable solution across a large organisation.

### Record Type behaviour tab

Steedos Content Manager administrators can set Record Type behaviour to ensure that the records that use the Record Type are represented correctly in terms of their nature:

- Document - individual documents 
- Folder - records that will contain documents - or other records 
- Series - to link records with disparate metadata.
- Box - container records, usually for archival purposes 
- Folder (Paper only) - used to create paper based records, i.e. records that will have no electronic components 

### Record Type Additional Fields tab

The Record Type Additional Fields tab enables you to activate existing Additional Fields for the Record Type and create new Additional Fields.

New Additional Fields created from within a Record Type will automatically be enabled for the Record Type - they will be tagged on both the Record Type Properties - Additional Fields tab and the field's Apply To tab.

You can modify an Additional Field using right-click - Properties on the field.

You can also modify Additional Fields by using Manage - Additional Fields.

Existing Additional Fields appear in the Additional Fields tab of each Record Type Properties and can be activated or deactivated by tagging them here.
